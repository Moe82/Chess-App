## About the project
### [Live Demo](https://github.com/Moe82/Chess-App-Backend)
The front end for a simple React chess app that I built for fun! It is connected to a [back end server](https://github.com/Moe82/Chess-App-Backend), which is hosted on Heroku. <br />

- A user can start a new game and invite his friend.
- A user can chat with his friend while playing.
- A user can play the AI and select a difficulty level (still working on this feature).
